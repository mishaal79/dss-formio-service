# ADR-001: Form.io Enterprise Edition Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-01-09

## Context
The DSS Form.io Service requires a robust form management platform that can handle enterprise-level requirements including advanced security, compliance, and scalability. We need to decide between Form.io Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.

## Decision
We have decided to use **Form.io Enterprise Edition** for the DSS Form.io Service deployment.

## Rationale

### Business Requirements
- **Enterprise-level Security**: Advanced security features required for production workloads
- **Compliance Support**: Enhanced compliance capabilities for regulatory requirements
- **Premium Support**: Access to professional support for critical business applications
- **Advanced Components**: Enterprise-only form components needed for complex forms

### Technical Considerations
- **License Available**: We have an active enterprise license (pOHMsV0uoOkfAS6q2jmugmr3Tm5VMt)
- **Infrastructure Compatibility**: Enterprise edition works with existing GCP infrastructure
- **Container Deployment**: Enterprise Docker image available (`formio/formio-enterprise:9.5.0`)
- **API Compatibility**: Full API compatibility with existing integrations

### Cost-Benefit Analysis
- **License Cost**: Enterprise license cost justified by feature set and support
- **Infrastructure Cost**: Same infrastructure cost as community edition
- **Operational Efficiency**: Premium support reduces operational overhead
- **Feature Value**: Enterprise features provide significant business value

## Implementation Details

### License Configuration
```hcl
use_enterprise = true
formio_license_key = "pOHMsV0uoOkfAS6q2jmugmr3Tm5VMt"
formio_image = "formio/formio-enterprise:9.5.0"
```

### Secret Management
- License key stored securely in Google Secret Manager
- Environment-specific secret versions for each deployment
- IAM-controlled access to license secrets

### Environment Deployment
- **Development**: Enterprise edition for feature compatibility testing
- **Staging**: Enterprise edition for production-like testing
- **Production**: Enterprise edition for full feature set

## Consequences

### Positive
- ‚úÖ **Advanced Features**: Access to enterprise-only form components and capabilities
- ‚úÖ **Premium Support**: Professional support channel for issue resolution
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Security**: Advanced security features and compliance tools
- ‚úÖ **Scalability**: Enterprise-grade scalability and performance optimizations
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Comprehensive enterprise documentation and guides

### Negative
- ‚ùå **License Cost**: Additional cost for enterprise licensing
- ‚ùå **License Management**: Need to manage license renewal and compliance
- ‚ùå **Dependency**: Dependency on Form.io enterprise services and support

### Neutral
- üîÑ **Migration Path**: Clear migration path back to community if needed
- üîÑ **Feature Compatibility**: All community features still available
- üîÑ **Infrastructure**: No additional infrastructure complexity

## Monitoring and Success Criteria

### Success Metrics
- Enterprise features successfully deployed and functional
- Premium support responsiveness meets SLA requirements
- Advanced security features properly configured and operational
- License compliance maintained across all environments

### Monitoring
- License usage tracking across environments
- Feature utilization monitoring
- Support ticket resolution time tracking
- Security feature effectiveness monitoring

## Risk Mitigation

### License Expiration Risk
- **Risk**: License expires on 08/29/2025
- **Mitigation**: Calendar reminders for renewal, documented renewal process
- **Fallback**: Migration plan to community edition if needed

### Vendor Lock-in Risk
- **Risk**: Dependency on Form.io enterprise services
- **Mitigation**: Maintain compatibility with community edition APIs
- **Fallback**: Clear migration path to community or alternative solutions

### Cost Management Risk
- **Risk**: Unexpected license cost increases
- **Mitigation**: Budget planning and cost monitoring
- **Fallback**: Feature evaluation and potential community migration

## Alternative Considered

### Form.io Community Edition
- **Pros**: No licensing cost, open source, basic feature set adequate
- **Cons**: Limited enterprise features, community support only, missing advanced security
- **Decision**: Rejected due to enterprise requirements and available license

## Future Considerations

### License Renewal Strategy
- Evaluate license usage and ROI before renewal date
- Assess feature utilization and business value
- Consider long-term licensing agreements for cost optimization

### Feature Evolution
- Monitor new enterprise features and their business value
- Evaluate community edition feature improvements
- Reassess edition choice annually during license renewal
